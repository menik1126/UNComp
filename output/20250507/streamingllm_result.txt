Benefit payments and related administrative expenses are paid out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal produced and sold domestically. If excise tax revenue is not sufficient to finance Black Lung Program benefits, the trust fund may borrow from the general fund of the Treasury, which contains federal receipts not earmarked for a specific purpose. For 2018, the tax rates on coal were $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 4.4% of the sales price. Starting in 2019, under current law, the excise tax rate on coal will likely put additional financial strain on the Black Lung Program.

batch_outputs is  ['\nThe Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to review certain types of federal agency actions that fall under the statutory category of "rules." Enacted in 1996 as part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, the CRA requires agencies to report the issuance of "rules" to Congress and provides Congress with special procedures under which to consider legislation to overturn those rules. A joint resolution of disapproval will become effective once both houses of Congress pass a joint resolution and it is signed by the President, or Congress overrides the President\'s veto. For an agency\'s action to be eligible for review under the CRA, it must qualify as a "rule" as defined by the statute. The class of rules covered by the CRA is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the Administrative Procedure Act\'s (APA\'s) notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA\'s procedures.

The LSE has stated that they take allegations of antisemitism and any other form of racism very seriously and are prepared to take disciplinary action if the allegations are found to be true.\n\nIn a separate incident, the Daily Telegraph reported claims that members of the Oxford University Conservative Association regularly sang an antisemitic song with Nazi references last November. This incident has raised concerns about the prevalence of antisemitism and Nazi-themed activities on university campuses in the UK.\n\nOverall, these incidents highlight the need for universities to take a strong stance against antisemitism and racism in all its forms. It is essential that students are made aware of the clear standards of behavior expected of them and that any breaches of these standards are dealt with swiftly and severely.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that compared to those with the lowest weight variability, those with the highest had a 78% higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death.\n\nCoronary artery disease develops when plaque builds up in the coronary arteries, which supply blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the heart. Repeatedly losing and gaining weight can have serious health implications for people with pre-existing heart disease, as it may lead to further narrowing of the coronary arteries and increase the risk of a heart attack.\n\nA healthy lifestyle can make a big impact in preventing and treating coronary artery disease. This includes maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, and managing stress.\n\nAdditionally, researchers have found that yo-yo dieting may have serious health implications for people with coronary heart disease. The study found that individuals with the highest weight variability had a higher risk of new onset diabetes, heart attack, stroke, and death compared to those with the lowest variability.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease and its complications.']

Ricks used computers, history, and his fellow forecasters to write a document titled "URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE," which was sent over the newswires and predicted that most of the area would be uninhabitable. The bulletin was considered by many to be the most dire and effective weather forecast ever issued by the NWS. Ricks\' bold statements have been officially encouraged by the NWS in recent years, as part of an effort to increase the effectiveness of government bulletins during true weather emergencies. In an interview with NBC News, Ricks discussed the experience and how it has affected him and his colleagues, who are now back at work after the storm with no homes and wearing the clothes they wore that day. The response to the forecast did break Ricks\' heart, as they always prepare for the big one but didn\'t think it would come so soon.']

This represents a premium of 37% to NYSE Euronext\'s closing stock price on Wednesday. The planned merger might pose fewer problems as ICE focuses on commodities like oil, natural gas, and cotton, while NYSE Euronext plies mainly in stock and stock options and derivatives. The deal could be announced as soon as Thursday morning, but talks may still break down.\n\nThe merger would create a powerful trans-Atlantic company with a big market share in the trading of stocks and derivatives. However, the Justice Department threatened to block the joint offer of Nasdaq and NYSE Euronext, on the ground that combining them would create an overwhelming monopoly in the world of stock trading. The planned merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche B√∂rse itself fell apart early this year after European antitrust regulators opposed the combination, on the ground that it would corner too much of the market in exchange-traded derivatives.\n\nThe takeover would seal the triumph of electronic trading over "open outcry" floor trading that long dominated financial markets, as well as the push by exchanges to embrace new and emerging technologies. The combined company would own 14 stock and futures exchanges and five clearing operations that serve as middlemen between buyers and sellers of futures and other contracts, doing more things in more places than any other rival.

batch_outputs is  ['\nThe latest news on colorectal cancer reveals a significant increase in younger patients, with a 37% rise in those diagnosed under the age of 50. This trend is consistent with previous studies, which suggest that the age of onset of colorectal cancer is decreasing. The reasons for this shift are not yet fully understood, but researchers believe that it may be due to changes in lifestyle and diet.\n\nIn addition to the increase in younger patients, the study also found that these patients are more likely to have advanced cancer at the time of diagnosis. Specifically, they are more likely to have regional or distant metastases, which are more dangerous than localized tumors. This suggests that early detection and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes in younger patients.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of improved risk assessment and screening for colorectal cancer. While current guidelines recommend screening beginning at age 50, the study suggests that this may need to be reevaluated in light of the increasing number of younger patients.\n\nOverall, the findings of this study underscore the need for continued research into the causes and prevention of colorectal cancer, as well as improved screening and treatment strategies for younger patients.']
