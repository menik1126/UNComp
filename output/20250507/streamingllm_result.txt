Benefit payments and related administrative expenses are paid out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal produced and sold domestically. If excise tax revenue is not sufficient to finance Black Lung Program benefits, the trust fund may borrow from the general fund of the Treasury, which contains federal receipts not earmarked for a specific purpose. For 2018, the tax rates on coal were $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal or $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, limited to 4.4% of the sales price.

batch_outputs is  ['\nThe Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to review certain types of federal agency actions that fall under the statutory category of "rules." Enacted in 1996 as part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, the CRA requires agencies to report the issuance of "rules" to Congress and provides Congress with special procedures under which to consider legislation to overturn those rules. A joint resolution of disapproval will become effective once both houses of Congress pass a joint resolution and it is signed by the President, or Congress overrides the President\'s veto. For an agency\'s action to be eligible for review under the CRA, it must qualify as a "rule" as defined by the statute. The class of rules covered by the CRA is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the Administrative Procedure Act\'s (APA\'s) notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA\'s procedures. The report provides a close examination and discussion of the statutory definition of "rule," the expedited procedures for considering legislation to overturn rules, and the class of rules covered by the CRA.']

They have found a way to reconstruct YouTube videos from viewers' brain activity. This technology has the potential to offer a glimpse into our dreams, memories, and even fantasies. The researchers used MRI machines to record the brain activity of their subjects while they watched YouTube videos. They then used this information to create a computer algorithm that could match neural patterns to dynamic visual information. The algorithm was able to reconstruct a YouTube video based on the brain activity of the subject, creating a continuous, abstract reconstruction of the actual video. This breakthrough could have significant implications for the field of neuroscience and could potentially lead to a better understanding of how the brain processes visual information.\n\nIn another development, scientists have found a way to see through another person's eyes.

However, there is evidence that the attack occurred earlier in the day in Syria, which would have been later in California.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that compared to those with the lowest weight variability, those with the highest had a 78% higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death.\n\nCoronary artery disease develops when plaque builds up in the coronary arteries, which supply blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the heart. Repeatedly losing and gaining weight can have serious health implications for people with pre-existing heart disease, as it may lead to further narrowing of the coronary arteries and increase the risk of a heart attack.\n\nA healthy lifestyle can make a big impact in preventing and treating coronary artery disease. This includes maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, and managing stress.\n\nAdditionally, researchers have found that yo-yo dieting may have serious health implications for people with coronary heart disease. The study found that individuals with the highest weight variability had a higher risk of new onset diabetes, heart attack, stroke, and death compared to those with the lowest variability.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease and its complications.']

This suggests that the roar of a T. rex may have been more of a gargling sound than a loud, deep roar. Additionally, the study found that the long-dead dinosaurs may have made more closed-mouth vocalizations than previously thought. These findings challenge the traditional view of dinosaurs as loud, roaring creatures and suggest that they may have been more like modern birds in terms of their vocalizations.\n\nIn other news, a new species of bird has been discovered in the Amazon rainforest, which is believed to be a close relative of the T. rex. The new species has been named the "Amazon T. rex" and is believed to be a fierce hunter.

The IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) is in talks to acquire the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE Euronext) for about $33 per share, with two-thirds of that in stock. This represents a premium of 37% to NYSE Euronext\'s closing stock price on Wednesday. The planned merger might pose fewer problems as ICE focuses on commodities like oil, natural gas, and cotton, while NYSE Euronext plies mainly in stock and stock options and derivatives. The deal could be announced as soon as Thursday morning, but talks may still break down.\n\nThe merger would create a powerful trans-Atlantic company with a big market share in the trading of stocks and derivatives. However, the Justice Department threatened to block the joint offer of Nasdaq and NYSE Euronext, on the ground that combining them would create an overwhelming monopoly in the world of stock trading. The planned merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse itself fell apart early this year after European antitrust regulators opposed the combination, on the ground that it would corner too much of the market in exchange-traded derivatives.\n\nThe takeover would seal the triumph of electronic trading over "open outcry" floor trading that long dominated financial markets, as well as the push by exchanges to embrace new and emerging technologies. The combined company would own 14 stock and futures exchanges and five clearing operations that serve as middlemen between buyers and sellers of futures and other contracts, doing more things in more places than any other rival.

batch_outputs is  ['\nThe latest news on colorectal cancer reveals a significant increase in younger patients, with a 37% rise in those diagnosed under the age of 50. This trend is consistent with previous studies, which suggest that the age of onset of colorectal cancer is decreasing. The reasons for this shift are not yet fully understood, but researchers believe that it may be due to changes in lifestyle and diet.\n\nIn addition to the increase in younger patients, the study also found that these patients are more likely to have advanced cancer at the time of diagnosis. Specifically, they are more likely to have regional or distant metastases, which are more dangerous than localized tumors. This suggests that early detection and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes in younger patients.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of improved risk assessment and screening for colorectal cancer. While current guidelines recommend screening beginning at age 50, the study suggests that this may need to be reevaluated in light of the increasing number of younger patients.\n\nOverall, the findings of this study underscore the need for continued research into the causes and prevention of colorectal cancer, as well as improved screening and treatment strategies for younger patients.']
